# train-activity

A train tracker that accepts user input and displays the time until the next train. Currently requires manual refresh to recalculate the time until the next train.

Future iterations will include automatic updates of the refresh field, train removal, column re-ordering, and more user input limits to prevent breaking the calculations.

Ignore app-backup-for-refresh-versioning.js file.
